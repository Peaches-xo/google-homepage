SKILLS I have learned from this project:
    - Staging, Committing and pushing to Git via VSCode
    - Using flexbox to position elements
    - Specificity & using selectors to target elements
    - Using :hover and adding drop shadows & other styling
    - How to add a favicon to the title bar

What I want to dive deeper into:
    - Flexbox layouts
    - Specificity
    - Using path and fill to 'colour' SVG elements, eg making the black magnifying glass icon grey
    - BEM to name ids and classes
    - media queries in relation to flexbox 

Things to come back to & change:
    - My google app icon looks to have square elements whereas the one on Google has looks to be rounded even though I sourced it from the google material icon page. Mine is black, googles is grey. 
    - The "Australia" bar disappears behind the bottom nav bar when the screen is made smaller. I would like it to be pushed to the top of the bottom nav bar. 
    - Search icon not being displayed in Google Chrome
